# Fermion Social Rep Protocol

A Fermi is a decentralised, social credit scoring unit. It seeks to be an alternative to centralised credit scores that exclude a majority of the population from access to fair credit. In times like the covid-19 crisis, it seeks to leverage the blockchain to enable 70% of the world to have access to credit. 

The practical constraints of reputation based systems is the need for breadth of reputation over depth (i.e. more sources to verify each user), as well as ongoing mutual incentives to encourage accurate reputation. We solve these by creating the Fermi Rep token, which is minted based on the CLR formula for public goods.

Fundamentally, a Fermi is different from money. Sending Fermi has a unique impact: it creates a permanent link between your Fermi Score and the reciever's Fermi Score. This way, people will be incentivised to build up networks of trusted contacts globally, in a decentraalised way. Credit can then effectively be provided to millions of such people at low risk.

Fermion protocol relies on two fundamental units:
1. The Fermi token - used to express "Trust" for another user, by linking your own reputation score to theirs. Approved Users recieve 100 Fermi a day, which are burnt if not spent in 24hrs.
2. The Fermi score - This is a decentralised credit score comprising: 50% of a weighted sum of all your peers, and 50% of your own deposit and replayment history. All Fermi Users begin with a score of 250.

A person needs to recieve at least 10 Fermi from 2 different addresses to become an "Approved user". Once approved, a user straight away enjoys a borrowing limit of $10 and a savings interest rate of ~8%. These limits increase with an increasing Fermi Score.

-Trust is a public good, and thus Fermi's grow when sent to other users based on the CLR funding model:

Points Recieved = Sq.(Sum of Sqrt of each individual reward) - detailed in token.sol

-Send Fermi to trusted connections, and boost your Fermi Score

-Enjoy increased borrowing limits, lower borrowing interest (<15%), and higher savings interest (>9%) as your Fermi Score increases.

Fermi score can be built by recieving more Fermi from other people with high ratings. 

This project is intended to be used with Buidler.

## Quick start

The first things you need to do are cloning this repository and installing its
dependencies:

```sh
cd Fermion-0.12
npm install
```

Once installed, let's run Buidler's testing network:

```sh
npx buidler node
```

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to
deploy your contract:

```sh
npx buidler run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Finally, we can run the frontend with:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your Dapp. You will
need to have [Metamask](http://metamask.io) installed and listening to
`localhost 8545`.

## User Guide

To try Fermi out, send some Fermi to another MetaMask wallet (Eth Address)! You'll notice that the reciever gets some more Fermi than sent, based on the CLR rule.
